## Goal of the application

- Build a responsive header exactly like the one in the directory “example” “example_header.png”. - Give your own twist on the design of the responsive (device) variant, take into consideration the user usability on the device(s).

## Points to take into consideration:

- The header uses an image slider with two images right now can be found in [/images/home_slide_01](/images/home_slide_01.png) and [/images/home_slide_02](/images/home_slide_02.png) .
- There shoud be a transition between these two images by clicking on the forward or backward button (you can use any button you want right here for use in the navigation).
- The text over the slider image should also be able to change while transitioning to a different slide

<br>

- The semi-transparant circle can be found in the images folder [/images/slider-overlay-circle.svg](/images/slider-overlay-circle.svg) should also be integrated into the slider.
- The yellow crescent moon shape van also be found in the images folder [/images/slider-overlay.png](/images/slider-overlay.png) should also be integrated into the slider.
- The menu-items should trigger a dropdown menu on hover - see [/example/example_menu.png](/example/example_menu.png).
- Only 1 dropdown needs to be worked out for this assessment.
- By clicking on the search icon a searchbox shoud appear to enter a searchword - see [/example/“searchbox_example.png](/example/“searchbox_example.png)

## Extras:

- Used colors: Blue: <strong>#002855</strong> / Yellow: <strong>#F2A900</strong> / Red: <strong>#EB3300</strong>
- Feel free to use a font style you want. We are not allowed to send any enclosed fonts we used in this example for the assessment, this also applies for the forward and backwards arrows in the slider.
- Also keep the SEO guidelines in mind.
  Keep your directory structure clear and well-arranged.
- The assessment can be buid locally, no need to put it into an web environment, but we leave that up to you. It is important for us to be able to review the source files.
